There it goes! >7 years of posting history. I'm somewhat relieved to have the
writings of my 17 year old self and younger removed from the internet.

Despite the trouble writing has often gotten me into, I really just can't seem
to help myself. Ideas just tend to rattle around in my head and refuse to shift
unless put down somewhere. I remember when I was interviewing for my very first
developer job & finding out that the interviewers had managed to read my more
private blog posts because I had neglected to filter the `private: true` posts
from my RSS feed. Yikes.

The internet has become a difficult place to remain anonymous in the last couple
decades, there's aren't any "safe" places left, maybe Tumblr at a push. Even
then, I still don't like being a cloud serf for a faceless corporation. Whatever
value we create is not respected, nor do we receive any compensation. So I'm
back here - back on my little island in the vast expanse talking into the void.

Hi.
