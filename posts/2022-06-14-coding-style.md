kiss, less is more, be terse & functional, influenced a lot by devs like:

- rxi <https://github.com/rxi>
- jdah <https://github.com/jdah>
- haze <https://github.com/haze>
- charm.sh <https://charm.sh> -- absolutely love this company, makes me wanna
  ssh all the things
- suckless <https://suckless.org> -- to a certain extent, their philosophy can
  kind of go a bit far though

they have a neat aesthetic, short usernames, brief READMEs coupled with super
useful & elegant code - i dunno it's weirdly appealing
