i've been learning norwegian on duolingo for about 9 days & today i had my first sort of conversation in it - which is cool considering i knew how to say fuck all a bit ago

went something like this:

    // they posted a picture of themselves, and there was cat box in the corner
    m: har du katter?
    t: Ja! Det er han som kommer ned trappen
    m: jeg ser en <insert word for cat box here>
    t: Øøøøh katte.. boks
    t: Jeg vet ikke hva vi kaller dem
    m: mfw jeg vet hva du sier

not a lot, but still, way more fun than just reading and doing flash cards on anki

anyways im hoping to try and get to a B1/C2 level by end of next year to take the bergentest to help with moving over there
