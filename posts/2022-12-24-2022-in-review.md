The most difficult year of my life in terms of recovery, but also the most
eventful so far, some moments;

- broke my jaw Dec 2021 and couldn't eat solid food for like 3 months really
- got into photography, went places with my friend & just enjoyed the activity,
  without ego - I also have a bunch of pics
  [on my flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/195303941@N08/)
- had a breakup from ltr
- moved from wales to bristol
- got my motorbike license -- have to wait until I'm 24 (soon!) to get my A
  class
  - [made motorbike friends :)](https://youtu.be/hy34tKBv-aQ?t=35)
  - did a bunch of exploring to new places on bike
- had bottom surgery (for free!)
  - then got covid really bad the week after, was in the hospital for like ~3
    wks total
- got some tattoos :0
- went to clubs / bars in Bristol
- started going to therapy, it's hard, but I'm hoping it'll get better
- started lifting weights in my living room
  - lost ~15kg this year pog
- migrated >30,000 customers from chargebee -> stripe in an epic project that
  spanned most of the year
- packed all my shit at 2am and went off to norway, had sushi with a norwegian
  girl in troms칮
- skateboarding???
- had vfs
- met my dad for the first time in 13 years

I don't really care that much about programming anymore, I literally do not care
that there's a new framework that has 1 second faster page hydration or that
there's some new typescript compiler in Rust - it's cool but I can't will myself
to care anymore, there's so much more to life than sitting infront of a
computer. I experienced a bit of that, I don't wanna waste any more of my life
attaching my self-esteem to how good I am at writing code, I am good enough.

From the previous post, 2021 in review I said I wanted to:

- 游릭 **actually use vim, stop using vscode**: yep did this in the time off at
  EoY 2021 and have been using neovim for the entire year non-stop in my
  day-to-day work, love it, never going back again - my rice
  <https://gitlab.com/cxss/dotfiles>
  - tangentially related but I love <https://github.com/rupa/z>
  - motions fuck hard, why the hell isn't everyone using vim
  - fzf is also super cool, so many uses for it
- 游리 **get back onto doing norwegian**: didn't really do this, but I did go to
  Norway! and spoke norwegian with people, so I would consider that a partial
  success...
- 游릭 **big choppa**: was meant to be jan 13th, but had it 5th june, now ~6.5
  months post-op, it's good for the most part, being able to piss without
  wanting to blow my head off with a 12 gauge is epic!
- 游댮 **write more go**: I wrote a bit, but not enough to mark this as a partial
  success, I also didn't complete much of my projects because this entire year
  was basically sucked up by billing migration at work (I was pulling some
  absolutely stupid hours at work)
- 游리 **escape voicehon**: I had VFS on the 5th december, my voice is still
  extremely hoarse so yet to see how it turns out, but I sound andro-ish already
- 游댮 **leave the cloud, go fully local powered by solar**: yeah nah, migration
  drained my soul & will to work on personal projects
- 游댮 **make game maybe**: dumb goal, no time outside of migration (common theme
  here...)
- 游릭 **maybe climb [Snowdon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowdon)**:
  [i did do some mountain climbing in norway](https://youtu.be/2C6jfc1a5SY) - i
  really enjoyed it & would like to do more next year, it's very peaceful

For next year:

- keep on with the weight-lifting, go to the gym rather than in my living room
  - apart from "we go jim" being some arbitrary goal just for the sake of it,
    I'd like to have some practical use out of it, wanna go do more
    mountaineering & being fitter will help with that!
  - & additionally to get over my anxiety of working out with other people
    around - I said to myself when I can bench a value I'd go to the gym
- get a haircut, it's actually getting absurd I've been cutting my fringe &
  nothing else since 2020
- develop my voice some more, VFS has definitely done a tonne of the legwork, I
  sound pretty androgynous now, I don't especially mind, but I should at-least
  put a bit of effort into it making it better
- have more tattoos -- my shoulders cause me a fair bit of dysphoria, but
  instead of being painfully frugal and saving to spend 20k on clavicle surgery,
  I spent 춲900 on a big chest tattoo, now I look at that more than my shoulders
  -- so I think if I get more then I'll appreciate myself a bit more than just
  finding new ways to criticise
- Get my full motorbike license, and maybe a gsxr600 游붐 with a full license I
  could travel abroad too! Would definitely be cool to ride around Scandinavia
  :)
- finally got my snowboard back from my mums, so do something with that in the
  winter, or go to dry-slopes near me
- set healthy boundaries at work, there is no way I'm having a repeat of this
  year, I get it's a startup but I literally felt like my entire soul was being
  drained from my body due to the sheer pressure, responsibility and time
  constraints
- use [fp-ts](https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts/) more, category / set theory is
  cool
- terminal UI's are super cool, I would like to actually finish off my
  [golang UI framework for bubbletea](https://gitlab.com/cxss/bubbles) &
  actually write an application using it, every couple months I add bits to it,
  but need to have a solid sit-down
