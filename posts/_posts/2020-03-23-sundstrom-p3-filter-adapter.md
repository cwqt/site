Quick COVID-19 related post, a few weeks ago when this was all kicking off I managed 
to get a nice deal on a set of five Sundström P3 filters and 25 pre-filters. The only 
issue being that they use a proprietary thread designed only for Sundström masks.
I have a Yugoslavian M1 gas mask which takes 60mm thread, seeing as though modern 
filters use the 40mm NATO thread I picked one of those 40-60mm adapters up for a
few quid on eBay  the same time as I was getting the filters.

Sundström and arco _do_ sell adapters to these threads but now that we're all in 
the shit they've decided to pull stock from civillian hands and re-direct it into 
the services.

So to not waste £20 on filters I 3d-modelled my own adapter.  
The model is composed of two parts, the thread and a bit that sits on top of the filter.

Firstly, print the two pieces, I used an Ender3 3d-printer with 1.75mm PLA grey filament.

You can see where this is going... thread goes in hole and circles latch on, I added 
a bunch of hot glue to keep the whole thing air-tight on the thread.

The bottom part is measured to be a perfect-ish seal around the rubber ring on the 
inside of the filter. I lacquerd the rim of the filter in hot glue and quickly 
pushed on the adapter to create a seal.

And tada...!, hopefully this helps someone out in the same situation :)  
I'm working on the pre-filter part since you can't exactly glue that bit on, I'll update this post when it's done.
