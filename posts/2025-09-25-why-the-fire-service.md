Since I've moved cities, when I meet new people and they ask me what I do, I
find myself telling them that "I'm training to join the fire service" rather
than "I'm a software engineer". To most people, when they find out the latter
are puzzled, yet supportive - why would someone perform such a pivot? For me. I
am doing it for me, not for money, status, or because some post online told me I
should do so - I am doing it because the thought of doing it fills me with an
energy that for the last few years has been completely absent.

I could write this whole post lamenting about software engineering as a
profession; the disrespect, office politics, incompetent management, unrealistic
timelines, excessive screen-time, health impacts, big egos, tech debt, cyclical
nature of technology, so on and so forth - but really pretty much every
criticism I could write could also be levelled at every other industry. So I
won't, instead I'll write about the pros of joining the Fire Service rather than
the cons of staying in tech; practically, politically and philosophically.

## Practically

I've been doing this a long time, 10 years even, the young teenager I was when I
first sat down at a computer to write my first lines of code simply isn't the
person I am now, and the world isn't the same either. The direction that
software engineering is heading with AI and agentic coding simply doesn't
interest me at all. Early when I was questioning my career, sat in quarterly
meets where topics such as user acquition, retention etc. were being discussed -
I would sit back in silence, look around, and think to myself "Does anyone
actually care about this?". The room would seem so endlessly long, and I would
feel so far away from it all.

Bubbling beneath this slow waning of interest in product development came a new
passion, weight lifting. I've been doing such for near 3 years now, and figured
whatever new avenue I went down had to have something to do with using my body -
perhaps a PT? paramedics? I've even been working on a mobile strength training
app for the last year or so in an attempt to marry the two. When I began
thinking about fire-fighting it lit that flame inside me that I had felt hadn't
been so bright for a while. It gave me a reason to train hard again.

## Politically

The world is kind of fucked right now, and maybe it's always been fucked, just
the manifestation of the fuckedness changes over time. Our generations problems
will involve climate change, that much is true. Politicians and business
interests can stick their heads in the sand or attempt to distort truth in the
public sphere, but the data doesn't lie. In the UK climate change
[made wildfires in 2022 six times more likely](https://www.ceh.ac.uk/news-and-media/news/climate-change-made-2022-fires-uk-six-times-more-likely)
and with atomospheric carbon dioxide levels now
[exceeding IPC 1.5c scenarios](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/climate/seasonal-to-decadal/seasonal-forecast/forecasts/co2-forecast)
I wager that the weather patterns will only intensify further.

Besides the climate issue, there is also the issue of the UK fire brigades often
being found out to be
[institionally racist, misogynistic and homophobic](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/nov/25/report-finds-misogyny-racism-and-bullying-at-london-fire-brigade) -
this doesn't exactly bode well for my personal set of circumstances, but nothing
will change if people like me continue adopt an avoidant strategy to these
issues. The only way attitudes will change is if we involved in the institutions
themselves. I am in a very fortunate position where I believe I have the
physical and mental health, resilience and grit to make a difference in this
regard where others cannot.

## Philosophically

---

Being in the Fire Service isn't just about fighting fires, there's a whole host
of responsibilites separate from that - community outreach being the one most
appealing to me. Politically speaking we're in a difficult time, the rise of
fascism, sexism, misogny etc. will continue to worsen unabated if nothing is
done about it. Our politicians largely don't care other than the occasional
platitude. What is required is every day people living according to their
values.

As a software engineer you exist on the edge of the corporate heirarchy, and
unless you go above and beyond every day (i.e. 10x engineer) your level of
respect from other members of the business (especially management) is virtually
zero. Most of the time you're considered a nuisance for caring about things like
"tech debt" or "team morale", the only thing that matters to a business is
generating revenue, fluffy stuff like mental health or respect are the first to
go when the money tree isn't shaking as many dollars out anymore.

My self-esteem for a long time was so low that I tolerated this, it's no
coincindence that the stereotype of an engineer is a sort of loser funko-pop
collector. Managers - or corporate in general - love the types that bow down
when faced with deadlines, it makes them look good. Personally? I'm not taking
their shit anymore.

The cultural environment has also shifted, back in the early 2010's there was a
real sense of internet technology genuinely changing how we lived, Big Tech
didn't have so many negative connotations, tech was stalward in progressivism,
championing LGBT acceptance et al. The thinking was, since tech was so
meritocratic, anyone was welcome.

I can't help but feel like it was all a total lie. 0% interest rates off the
back of 2008 provided ample capital to test fun & fresh ideas, but the few
corporations that succeeded about the back of that period seem only to be more
effecient at exploiting workers and capital accumulation.

> external to the worker, i.e., it does not belong to his intrinsic nature; that

> not feel content but unhappy, does not develop freely his physical and mental
> energy but mortifies his body and ruins his mind. The worker therefore only
> feels himself outside his work, and in his work feels outside himself.

> The problem with capitalism is that there’s never a moment in the flywheel to

> more. “Record profits” are celebrated as triumphs.

> But what if profits weren’t the only, or even primary, incentive? What if we
> rewarded employee wellbeing, positive community and environmental impact,
> innovations that reduced suffering or improved health not because they could
> be commodified but simply because they mattered?

> It's like a corporate version of the emperor’s new clothes, except everyone

> "Success is living in accordance with your values"

I like how Frederick Brooks put it: """

Why is programming fun? What delights may its practitioner expect as his reward?

First is the sheer joy of making things. As the child delights in his mud pie,
so the adult enjoys building things, especially things of his own design. I
think this delight must be an image of God's delight in making things, a delight
shown in the distinctness and newness of each leaf and each snowflake.

Second is the pleasure of making things that are useful to other people. Deep
within, we want others to use our work and to find it helpful. In this respect
the programming system is not essentially different from the child's first clay
pencil holder "for Daddy's office."

Third is the fascination of fashioning complex puzzle-like objects of
interlocking moving parts and watching them work in subtle cycles, playing out
the consequences of principles built in from the beginning. The programmed
computer has all the fascination of the pinball machine or the jukebox
mechanism, carried to the ultimate.

Fourth is the joy of always learning, which springs from the nonrepeating nature
of the task. In one way or another the problem is ever new, and its solver
learns something: sometimes practical, sometimes theoretical, and sometimes
both.

Finally, there is the delight of working in such a tractable medium. The
programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff.
He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by the exertion of the
imagination. Few media of creation are so flexible, so easy to polish and
rework, so readily capable of realizing grand conceptual structures....

Yet the program construct, unlike the poet's words, is real in the sense that it
moves and works, producing visible outputs separate from the construct itself.
It prints results, draws pictures, produces sounds, moves arms. The magic of
myth and legend has come true in our time. One types the correct incantation on
a keyboard, and a display screen comes to life, showing things that never were
nor could be.

Programming then is fun because it gratifies creative longings built deep within
us and delights sensibilities we have in common with all men.
