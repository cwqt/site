title: Our current fucking juncture

I don't think you really notice how much we are conditioned into self-censoring
online by social media until you're sat cosy-like in your own back yard and free
to say whatever the fuck you want. Anyways this leads me into our current
juncture.

The year is 2025, wealth inequality has almost reached a point greater than that
of the Gilded Age, "the economy" has completely uncoupled itself from any actual
representation of living standards & a fascist takeover of the most militarily
powerful nation state is actively in-progress.

At the center of it all, a demagogue - who has given a roman-salute-toting
tech-bro oligarch a free pass to consolidate power & cannibalize the tentacles
of the empire. Of which a non-insignificant part is being driven by a dorm room
of socially inept virgin kids at a quasi-government agency named after a
painfully stale 2010's meme of a dead dog.

If you know anything about the histories of empires you can make a decent stab
at how all of this is may turn out. Armed with historical materialism you have
what could be called something akin to a university degree in Truth. Not the
false conciousness "satanic cabal of baby-raping adrenaline-laden-blood-drinking
elites are running the world" truth, the one that lets you build a precise model
of this grotesque, duplicitous system, from its conception, its mode of
operation and potentially its destination.

Powerful and enduring nationalism (MAGA), identification of enemies (LGBT),
supremacy of the military (...), controlled mass media (manufactured consent),
corporate power protected (2008 subprime crisis),
[labour power suppressed](https://youtu.be/AQeGBHxIyHw), disdain for
intellectuals and the Arts (wokeness)... just to name a few obvious ones. The 14
characteristics of fascism are in their terminal stages of fulfillment - the
American people are on a set trajectory into something ugly, the same ugliness
that lead to the death over 75 million 79 years ago - the darkness of the human
spirit is making its return.

All empires rise & fall, this is an inevitability, to disagree is to be ignorant
of all of human history.

The real question is how will the fall look? The effect to human life is what I
worry about most... a managed retreat from global dominance? maybe a small civil
war or coup leading to balkanization? It wouldn't surprise me if the American
ego, with all its blood-lust and narcissistic exceptionalism, decided to take
the rest of the world down with it in one final blaze of atomic glory. The last
great human empire. That last bit is a bit doomerish, though realistically
possible.

In spite of it all however, it's important to carry with us revolutionary
optimism, the hope & belief that a better future is possible, not just as
individuals, but as a species - that from the ashes of this toxic system
something beautiful can rise in its place, where all are equal; none go hungry,
none are homeless, none are ordered to die in wars, none are exploited, none are
poisoned by the command of capital - where each person is free to live their
lives unshackled by implanted desires, shame & hatred - to love one and other in
the purest sense of the word.

Nowdays I think I understand that the current cruelty of it is the point, there
is no use in being perpetually outraged or suprised when the
people-eating-machine eats more people. So what can we do right now? Log off,
build community, exercise - get strong, learn deeply, graffiti on things, shake
off all the false ideas of yourself you thought to be true, develop skills that
make you useful outside of this bullshit system. Find ways to resist, subvert,
to endure. Keep moving, stay kind, we will out-live these parasitic bastards.
