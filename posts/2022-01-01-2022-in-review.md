physical trauma leaving me bound to laying in bed; this year being no
different...

</div>

some things have changed this year however! though before enumerating over those
i'll take a look at the things i said i _wanted_ to get done this year:

- **Finish the Duolingo tree**: admittedly i have fallen off a bit with the
  norwegian, though only because my priorities have shifted somewhat: this year
  according to [duome.eu/cwassie](https://duome.eu/cwassie) i've done
  **361/590** lessons on the tree. the norwegian tree is the longest on the
  platform & i'm fairly happy with the progress i've made reading-wise with the
  language
- **Get to B2 CEFR level**: i think i'm probably around an A2-B1 which the level
  of content i can read/understand, which is ok considering i havent done a
  whole lot these last 3 months other than maintain
- **Improve fitness**: I did get an exercise bike and use it a fair bit at the
  start of the year, more recently I've been playing a lot of beatsaber which
  has helped a bunch with consistent exercising
- **Release the MVP**: nope, more on that later
- **Sell some microgreens at the local farmers market**: nope again
- **Go on holiday to either Norway/Japan**: turkey! covid still being cringe
- **Stop trying to achieve perfection**: on and off achieved this one
- **<small>voice training**: yep, started off good, had a shit time with and
  SLT, stopped for 6 months and then started again, with some success too ^^
  maybe this year i will stop being such a huge pussy and use it outside my
  house</small>

and the things i'd _liked_ to have done?

- **Add i18n to this site**: yup did this, and did end-to-end typesafe i18n to a
  full-stack app -- which was fun
- **Dress more fashionably**: arguably my most successful point, if nothing else
  by virtue of having a lot of expendable income
- **Soft skills** i guess? a lot of this is tied to my voice, but other stuff
  like time management i've improved a lot on
- **Make mistakes**: ohhhhhhhhhhh yes.
- **Maybe climb [Snowdon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowdon)**: nope..though
  i will for sure this year!

# this year

- **got my own place**: no more house sharing! have a nice 3 bed, 2 bath, garage
  & garden in a comfy welsh town
- **did a big startup thing**: wrote a shitload of code, like a stupid amount
  building an event driven livestreaming & vod platform, my own node backend
  framework, ci/ci pipeline from scratch, docker, terraform, gh actions, GCP
  cloud registery/run/compute/storage/sql - maybe i'll open source it if it all
  goes tits up
- **left said startup thing**: ultimately was sucking away my entire life for
  basically no money, working with very inexperienced people in a product i only
  really liked because of the technical challenge it presented - once that was
  done much of the motivation dissipated
- **some personal projects**: significantly less due to startup hoovering all my
  time
  - <https://gitlab.com/cxss/tui-designer>
  - <https://gitlab.com/cxss/awgit>
  - <https://gitlab.com/cxss/mqfc>
  - [https://gitlab.com/cxss/miljo](https://gitlab.com/cxss/miljo/-/tree/master/serverless)
    mostly just ideasguying
  - <https://gitlab.com/cxss/stir>, stirred a lot of ideas for
    <https://gitlab.com/cxss/bootloader>
- **became a senior dev**: kind of surprised me but I'll take it
- **learned new tech/tools**: Mostly devops, upping my TS-fu and learning a new
  stack
  - Terraform/GH Actions
  - bunch of GCP tooling
  - Jest / frontend testing
  - React/Next.js
  - Tailwind
  - Nest.js
  - more MongoDB (can't say i'm exactly thrilled about these last 2)
  - Go, been learning this more recently and quite enjoying it

on another note I've more than tripled my salary through switching jobs since
the start of my career , I now look at money through a very different lens, I
used to be so frugal (and still kind of am). I thought having lots of money
would solve a lot of things in my life, but now I have it just piling up in my
bank account I'm a bit saddended by the realisation it doesn't.

impermanance is another thing, impermanence of friendships, good times & bad,
songs, movies, youth, just... knowing that things will pass. kind of sucks. i'm
not especially great at expression but the thought of it has been twisting me up
a bit inside this year

i think a lot of this is due to maturing somewhat. i'll be 23 year year which is
kind of fucking silly. in some ways im ahead of most people, but for the most
part i'm playing catch up. not that there's some kind of universal par for life,
but i dunno, i'm in pain right now haha

anyways, for 2022 (pog number)

# things to do

- actually use vim
- get back onto doing norwegian
