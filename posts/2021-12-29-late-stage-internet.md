we're entering the end game, the internet not a tool for connecting, sharing,
bringing people together or any other nice feel good words or platitudes. it's
all just money. things like [gemini](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/) have
popped up which go to the absurd length of creating an entirely new protocol to
escape the digital noise.

every bit of data streamed off the backs of millions of engineering hours serves
nothing more than to line someones pocket, a yellow pages for subscriptions,
deals, sales, "Buy Now", paypal, apple pay, google pay, pay pay pay pay pay buy
our product, sign up to our newsletter, accept our cookies, read our gdpr
notices, e-mail reminders, pop-up chat boxes. _BUY OUR PRODUCT_.

i liked computers because i was always lonely and the seemingly infinite
complexity of these machines served as a good distraction, now i'm at a point
where i know how all these pieces fit together there's no magic anymore. i wish
i could go back to 2018 writing assembler making music on microcontrollers.

ahhhhhhhhhhhh i hate being so depressingly pessimistic

# building blocks

apparently noone seems to _make_ web apps anymore, everything on the internet is
a hastily cobbled & designed with the singular purpose of getting the thing out
tht door as fast as humanly possible. the average 2022 website will consist of
nothing but an html, single script tag, with 50 million lines of transpiled
typescript sourced from a single `App.tsx` that looks something like this.

```jsx
<NextJsCDNProvider>
  <AgoliaSearchBar />
  <h1>SaaS Product 2022!</h1>
  <MUXVideoPlayer />
  <RefinerMicroFeedbackForm />
  <DisquisCommentsSection />
  <AnnounceKitProductUpdatesPopup />
  <HubspotSignupForm />
</NextJsCDNProvider>
```

BUILD. DEPLOY. SCALE.

## engagement hacking

![](https://ftp.cass.si/0y960tg0~.png)

these kinds vote posts asking pointless questions seem to be pegged as high user
engagement, so content creators put put these posts like
`"what is your favourite colour"` to boose engagement to increase ranking in the
algorithm. using mental health as a question for this is just so low

## soy art

stupid noodle arm rounded corner "trust me" no offensive blurple corporate art.

maybe im just burned out by the internet, maybe i just hate industrial society,
maybe i fried my brain from years of flat out development chasing some figure
deposited into my bank at the end of every month. now i see the number increment
and feel nothing. it just a digit, not even present in any kind of physical
form, loaned out the microsecond it arrives if even the cabal of financial
mega-entities even carried out the transaction... just a `total += incoming` or
`total -= outgoing` on a private ledger synced at some distant point in time.
any contribution is a pile of sand, im going to blow my fucking head off out at
this rate
