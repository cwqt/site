In order to retain my sanity (and mostly keep myself occupied) whilst at college (which still sucks by the way), I've decided to embark on yet another electronics project.

The PiSP, a portmanteau of the **Raspberry Pi** and the **Sony Play Station Portable**, is a handheld console with a similar controls scheme to a **PSP**, D-pad to the left, XYBA to the right, PSP 1000 thumbstick and all, the usual shtick of handhelds of today, except powered by a **Pi Zero W**.

The idea came to me one day during the summer holidays, and then I just decided I'd also make a "OS" in **LÃ–VE**. A few weeks later and PiSPOS was born.

Needless to say getting this to work on the Pi was a total pain in the ass, at least my life was made a bit easier by the fact that [PiLove](http://pilove.mitako.eu/) exists, which handles all the SDL/OpenGLES pain. I had to mess around with building fbtft kernel modules ([thanks notro](https://github.com/notro/fbtft)), compiling imgui, framebuffer mirroring, SDL resolution issues; as well as dealing with the unreliable Adafruit display (don't buy adafruit, it's robbery).

The development of the OS itself went fine though, apart from a major re-architecture a week ago when I realized procedurally programming clients was going to get out of hand, my previous attempt at writing imgui into and object-orientated design went tits up so I just ran with it.

Currently things are a bit more sane, each page contains 6 icons (or slots, the naming convention is all over the place), which each have a client class inside them, for example, to create:

![PiSP]({{site::ftp_assets}}/PiSP-objects-ex.png)

I simply,

```lua
pages = {}
table.insert(pages, page:new({
    { games:new(),      "Games",   "images/Luv/categories/32/games.png" },
    { console:new(),    "Console", "images/Luv/apps/48/terminal.png" },
    { editor:new(),     "Editor",  "images/Luv/categories/32/editor.png" },
    { files:new(),      "Files",   "images/Luv/apps/48/filemanager.png" },
    { music:new(),      "Music",   "images/Luv/apps/32/music.png" },
    { metrics:new(),    "Metrics", "images/Luv/apps/32/metrics.png" }
}))

--...

for k, page in ipairs(pages) do
    -- Define an actual x position for the camera
    page.ax = screen.W**(k-1)
    -- Shift each page to the right
    page:draw(page.ax, 0)
end
```

Which creates a new page, complete with icons, and clients. So yeah.

Right now I'm waiting on a bunch of parts to get going, I hope to be finished by December this year.

If anyone knows of a good 2.2" touchscreen TFT let me know, this overly expensive Adafruit poop has been getting on my nerves for weeks now...
