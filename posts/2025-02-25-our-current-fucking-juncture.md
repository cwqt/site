title: Our current fucking juncture

I don't think you really notice how much we are conditioned into self-censoring
online by social media until you're sat cosy-like in your own back yard and free
to say whatever the fuck you want. Anyways this leads me into our current
juncture.

The year is 2025, wealth inequality has almost reached a point greater than that
of the Gilded Age, "the economy" has completely uncoupled itself from any actual
representation of living standards & a fascist takeover of the most militarily
powerful nation state is actively in-progress.

At the center of it all, a demagogue - whose given a "roman-salute"-toting
tech-bro oligarch a free pass to consolidate power & cannibalize the tentacles
of the empire - for reasons. Of which a non-insignificant part is being driven
in dorm room of socially inept virgin kids at a quasi-government agency named
after a painfully stale 2010's meme of a dead dog.

This whole thing is careening into a fucking ditch in real-time. If you know
anything about the histories of empires you can make a decent stab at how all of
this'll pan out. Historical materialism arms you with a university degree in
Truth. Not the false conciousness "satanic cabal of baby-raping
adrenaline-laden-blood-drinking elites are running the world" truth, but the one
that lets you build a precise model of this grotesque, duplicitous system, from
its conception, its mode of operation and potentially its destination. And right
now? Right now, we're at the point just before the airbag deploys.

Powerful and enduring nationalism (MAGA), identification of enemies (LGBT),
supremacy of the military (...), controlled mass media (manufactured consent),
corporate power protected (2008 subprime crisis),
[labour power suppressed](https://youtu.be/AQeGBHxIyHw), disdain for
intellectuals and the Arts (wokeness)... just to name a few obvious ones. The 14
characteristics of fascism are in their terminal stages of fulfillment - the
American people are on a set trajectory into something ugly, the same ugliness
that lead to the death over 75 million 79 years ago - the darkness of the human
spirit is making its return.

All empires rise & fall, this is an inevitability, to disagree is to be ignorant
of all of human history. The real question what will this fall look like? A
managed retreat from global dominance? Perhaps a small civil war or coup leading
to balkanization? It wouldn't surprise me if the American ego, with all its
blood-lust and narcissistic exceptionalism, decided to take the rest of the
world down with it in one final blaze of atomic glory. The last great human
empire. That's maybe a bit doomer.

In spite of it all however, it's important to carry with us revolutionary
optimism, the hope & belief that a better future is possible, that from the
ashes of this toxic system something beautiful can rise in its place, where all
are equal; none go hungry, none are homeless, none are ordered to die in wars,
none are exploited, none are poisoned by the command of capital - where each
person is free to live their lives unshackled by implanted desires, shame &
hatred - to love one and other in the purest sense of the word.

Nowdays I think I understand that the cruelty of it all is the point. There is
no point in being perpetually outraged or suprised when the
people-eating-machine eats more people. So what can we do right now? Log off,
build community, exercise - get strong, learn deeply, graffiti on things, help
others, shake off all the false ideas of yourself you thought to be true,
develop skills that make you useful outside of this bullshit system. Find ways
to resist, subvert, to endure. Stay kind - we will out-live these bastards.
