this site has been around in one form or another for going on 5 years now & i'm mostly at the point now where i don't care all that much about its design, hence its present spartan look

when i was much younger i used to care a lot more about this kind of thing (mainly because i didn't know how to do much else) - i was big into the ricing/startpages scene which has seemed to all but die out nowadays, i figure now is a good a time as any to take a stroll down memory lane and look at the many designs this site has undergone

<!-- 2016 -->
<a data-caption="2016, christened on the first few days of new years 2016, this was _the first_ iteration; made as a place to store some notes from electronics class to share with people in my college, handmade html with everything horribly absolutely positioned - the site was never actually available at `mktt.moe` i thought thought the `.moe` tld was cool apparently" href="https://ftp.cass.si/gd9iw04qa.png"></a>
<a data-caption="the first iteration built entirely on Jekyll (a common theme). i think with this one i figured out how to do CSS animations and had this cool slidey-out drawer thing" href="https://ftp.cass.si/=9duk79sa.png"></a>
<a data-caption="2016, not much to say about the next two - i was experimenting a lot with web design & finding all kinds of CSS selectors and applying them to a silly degree, sliding, hovering, filtered things galore" href="https://ftp.cass.si/22127k999.png"></a>
<a data-caption="2016" href="https://ftp.cass.si/7460umas7.png"></a>
<!-- 2017 -->
<a data-caption="2017, this was the year where i started to gain an appreciation for what a nicely designed website looked like - this period has served me well into the future, it was also the year with the most complete re-writes because apparently i had nothing better to do. i remember the pictures in the background would bob up & down - was pretty aesthetic" href="https://ftp.cass.si/6v75z299a.png">
<a data-caption="2017, LaTeX obsession at highest levels" href="https://ftp.cass.si/0~927Seqc.png"></a>
<a data-caption="2017, going for more of a bloggy format - not sure why I had authors since I was the only person that wrote anything for it" href="https://ftp.cass.si/j54904790.png"></a>
<a data-caption="2017" href="https://ftp.cass.si/9dm7b=419.png"></a>
<a data-caption="2017, a total design rip from leafo.net when i was big into MoonScript" href="https://ftp.cass.si/99~y4kQf0.png"></a>
<!-- 2018 -->
<a data-caption="2018, starting doing some client-side javascript to create a CMS of sorts by sending API requests to GitHub & having a CI pipeline to build the changes" href="https://ftp.cass.si/f1vB=2d14.png"></a>
<a data-caption="2018" href="https://ftp.cass.si/yguc154av.png"></a>
<a data-caption="2018" href="https://ftp.cass.si/F1u42r~21.png"></a>
<!-- 2019 -->
<a data-caption="2019, had this horrible horizontal sliding design that would bug out all the time" href="https://ftp.cass.si/41aa3imq2.png"></a>
<a data-caption="2019, discovered xxiivv and abused ::after on <a> tags because that was the design trend or something" href="https://ftp.cass.si/4tqf5919r.png"></a>
<!-- 2020 -->
<a href="https://ftp.cass.si/f1x8680h5.png" data-caption="2020"></a>
<a href="https://ftp.cass.si/5d57v9.p8.png" data-caption="2020, made a graph thingy visualising commits/code time using TimeSink"></a>
<a href="https://ftp.cass.si/c~89p4f9v.png" data-caption="2020"></a>
<a href="https://ftp.cass.si/jy2660u0a.png" data-caption="2020, expanded upon time collecting & created awgit https://gitlab.com/cxss/awgit"></a>
</div>

even this doesn't fully cover every change, there are probably 10 other missing from this list, in general i think i've had my fill of static site generators, now i've settled on using [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/) and [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) mainly because it's the one with the least shit getting in my way
