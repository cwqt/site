some 7 hours away, last time i'll have this thing meant to retrospect on this a
week ago but never bothered to get around to it

how do i feel? don't know...nervous..been having panic attacks every other in
the weeks leading up which has sucked a fair bit

how do i know this is right thing? if im even thinking that is that a sign it
isnt? is it normal to have doubts? how am i going to cope with recovery? what if
i regret it? what if it goes wrong? what if i don't like it?

feels different than ffs, this is a whole new organ basically face surgery is
just you...but prettier, it's something you can look forward too

this is going to be months of suffering.

don't get me wrong i do definitely hate having this thing it's been the source
of a lot of anxiety and just...lackluster living having to deal with it every
day, i just wwant the end game but without having to go through the mountain of
shit that awaits me
