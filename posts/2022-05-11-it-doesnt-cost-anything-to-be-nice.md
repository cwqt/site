just because i hate myself doesn't mean i have to project those negative
emotions onto others by being generally unkind - not in an intentional manner
but just emanating that kind of aura of coldness you feel towards yourself

it's hard when you're occassionally passively suicidal to really want to say
much to anyone, but i've been trying it to go out of my way to write/say
positive things like; "thank you", "take care" & "have a nice weekend". even if
you would never say those things to yourself/dislike being on the receiving
because you believe you don't deserve such things, saying it to others i think
makes you subconciously internalise those words

maybe another part of it is that noone is going to criticise you for being nice,
so they're aspects of conversation that you feel the least self-concious about &
ultimately closing with something like the above makes it less likely to
overthink what was said prior

this post has been a weird mix of 1st/2nd person, probably because i don't like
talking about myself
