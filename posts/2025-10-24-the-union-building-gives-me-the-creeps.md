title: The U+NION building gives me the creeps

I moved to Manchester a couple months ago now, it's a nice place, bigger than
Bristol, smaller than London, a decent sized city where one could reasonably
walk the diameter of the ring-road in under an hour. When I go outside in the
evening to take in the brisk autumnal air (and to have a smoke), the sunsets
with their pink and blue tints and feel the crunch of leaves beneath me, I
always notice the U+NION (or you-plus-neon as I've come to call it) in the
distance.

U+NION (<https://liveunion.com/>), a skyscaper presenting fully erect and
piercing into the skyline, is adorned with a great neon sign glowing it's great
white hue, often handily acting as the lighthouse that guides me home (since I
no longer carry a smartphone on my outings), secondary to that, it also serves
many a young professional as their place of residence.

A co-living space, gym, cafe/bar & club all rolled into one starting at 900 odd
quid per month. For a young professional on a salary of ~30k that'd represent
~30-40% of a monthly income, bills included - not too bad all considered in the
present day. The building itself is owned by Vita Group, self-proclaimed "urban
development regeneration specialist" and "fully vertically-integrated developer,
seller and operator of property investment products" -
[whose revenue & EBITDA in 2024](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/11963176/filing-history/MzQ4MjM0MjkwOGFkaXF6a2N4/document?format=pdf&download=0)
stood at £254.2m and £62.5m respectively.

So what about it? it's just a business, why do you care?. The issue I take is
that the U+NION's brands marketed community aspect is fake as fuck - a
pre-packaged sense of authentic urban community cooked up in a boardroom.
Togetherness as a service. As a tenant, upon admission you're to take some sort
of test and then algortithmically matched with the people who you're to live
with - ever so helpfully replacing the messiness that comes with organically
creating social relationships. Imagine meeting your neighbours: "Hello, the
algorithm has placed us in close proximity due to the overlap of our personality
metrics and interests! So lovely to make your acquaintance!" - all in the name
of high tenant retention! U+NION needs the people that live there to form
connections as lonely & isolated tenants are more likely to leave.

There's a structural reality here that this is a corporation mediating young
peoples social lives, and their friendships serve as a value add to
shareholders. Their community is an avenue for value extraction and profit
seeking. What this building represents to me is just another furthering in the
commodification of community itself. Previous generations formed communities
through churches, unions and neighbourhood associations. When groups of people
did live together, they did so in housing co-operatives that they themselves
owned, they held democratic decision junctures to influence how things were ran,
a far cry from a multi-national corporation designing your life through A/B
testing.

Vita Group has capitalized on a fertile opportunity for rent extraction created
by two converging conditions: the atomized, isolated nature of contemporary
urban life generates demand for community, while housing scarcity eliminates
alternatives - monetizing loneliness and necessity simultaneously. The building
towers over the city center, glowing its promise of belonging. What it actually
illuminates is how thoroughly we've allowed capital to mediate the basic human
need for connection.
