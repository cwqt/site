I've been developing a system to monitor, track & orchestrate indoor farming on and off
for the last year. It's been going pretty well & I'm almost at the point where I can
start developing the hardware to work with it, it's open-source and anyone can create devices, but
I'll need a few to test it out - obviously.

There comes a time though when you need to do some practical work - I've never grown much
of anything in my whole life, so some experience in how it all works will aid me in developing
the system. My farm consists of 1 level with a 300-800nm spectrum grow light, for bigger veggies
like lettuces and 4 levels with red&blue strip LEDs for microgreens.

# Growing pea shoots

**Step 1:** Soaking the seeds

I bought some trays from AliExpress to do soil-less growing & filled the whole thing with pea shoot seeds -
totally way too much as you'll see later;

All in, this was about `200g` unsoaked. These were then soaked in a bowl of water for around 15 hours.

**Step 2:** Germination

After allowing the seeds to soak, they had grown to be pretty much double in size,
mine weighed `397g` post soak - I then evenly distributed the seeds in the tray and covered the
tray so the seeds were in total darkness. Every few hours I lightly misted the seeds with water.
Do this for 2 days.

Since the seeds grew so much they far exceeded the single trays capacity, so I had to split them
over two trays - seeing as I had two sets of lights (white & red/blue) I did a little experiment to see what the difference would be in growth.

<br />
**Step 3:** Growing up

After about 2 days of blackout, I uncovered the seeds and exposed them to light for ~18hrs a day.

It seems as if the pea shoots were more 'leggy' under the red/blue light, but that may just
be due to how close the plants were relative to the lights, I couldn't really tell any noticeable
difference in taste though. My final yield is as follows:

- **red/blue**: input: `129g`, output: `78g`, io ratio: `0.604`
- **white**: input: `268g`, output: `178g`, io ratio: `0.664`

All in all the pea shoots only took 10-ish days from seed to harvest, so definitely
possible to put on rotation for an unlimited supply. I eventually plan to step up production
to use all 5 levels & sell these at the local farmers market. ðŸŒ±
