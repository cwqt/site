title: new years stuff
---

I wrote a "year in review" thing every year since I started having a website up in 2016, but back then being a depressed teenager with not much going on in their life apart from study & cry they were all kind of boring, now they're all gone & I'm starting over :)

This year I have actual life events though ðŸŽ‰ in order from start to end of the year:

* __Moved out from home & in with my boyfriend__: Away from horrible North England and into much nicer Wales
* __Got my first developer job__: Full-stack at a small business, was there for all of three-ish weeks before lockdown started & perma-work from home thereon after. I learned a lot from this place & it was probably the best 'first dev job' I could've hoped for; no super-intense pace, interesting greenfield project, very kind group of people, awesome manager & a stack I was already confident with
* __Learned TypeScript + tonnes of other technologies__: Related to the previous, in no particular order I've learned:
  - TypeScript (+ Express a lot more)
  - Angular, RxJS, Pub-Sub pattern
  - Docker + Kubernetes
  - Redis, InfluxDB, Chronograf
  - PostgreSQL + TypeORM, MongoDB + mongoose
  - Vercel Serverless, AWS Textract, SNS & SQS
  - Micro-services & task runners / queues
  - Neo4j + cypher
  - mocha & chai (lord i loathe testing)
  - RabbitMQ / MQTT
* __Started growing plants__: Bought a [huge shelf and stacked it with lights](https://cass.si/posts/growing-microgreens-and-mcn) & sensors and all other IoT stuff
* __Got my first raise__
* __Went to Belgium (again)__: ðŸ˜‰
* __Left my first developer job__
* __Joined a startup incubator__
* __Became a bird whisperer__: Got myself a bird feeder & now I'm this apartment complexes social club for birds
* __Incorporated a company__: Suppose now I'm a CTO of sorts in a startup with 4 other people, we're building a livestream & VOD service for performance arts, with all the experience of my last job so far a tonne of progress has been made
* __Went out into town__: On a double date I guess? Normally I never would've done something like this being an anxious person and whatnot
* __Started learning a second language (Norwegian)__: Got tired of learning programming languages so learning a real one now, det gÃ¥r bra :)
* __First Christmas from home__: Thanks very much Mark Drakeford ðŸ˜ 

# Things I _want_ to do next year:

* __Finish the Duolingo tree__
* __Get to B2 CEFR level__ Bergentest kanksje?
* __Improve fitness__: Get back into running again, lose some weight yada yada / weight cycling
* __Release the MVP__: Q2 2021...? + funding pls
* __Sell some microgreens at the local farmers market__
* __Go on holiday to either Norway/Japan__: Test out my language skillz or my boyfriends' japanese - maybe both?
* __Re-write my activity tracker__: Already started on this one: <https://gitlab.com/cxss/awgit>
* __Relax my perfectionism a bit__
* __~~<small>voice training</small>~~__

# Things I'd _like_ to do next year:

* __Learn some new tools__: AWS EKS + K8s more in general, Helm, DevOps stuff
* __Re-write a bunch of stuff__: I have a fair bit of basically shit code hanging about on servers that I should clean up - speaking of which maybe I'll make a thing to monitor the uptime of all of these applications - https://status.cass.si - pog?
* __Add i18n to this site__: Norwegian translations, maybe even a dark mode too
* __Go outside more__: Been pretty hard what with COVID / anxiety
* __Read more books__: Only thing I've read this year is Ted K's manifesto :/
* __Make some more hardware__: Would really like to continue my growing operation, albeit a bit more casually, cut out a bunch of stuff I built so I can actually finish it and let people use it
* __Dress more fashionably__: Currently I just wear oversized hoodies and yeah, maybe try some makeup other than concealer too while I'm at it?
* __Soft skills__: Be more supportive, a better communicator & time management, agile schtuff
* __Maybe climb [Snowdon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowdon)__:

# What _not_ to do next year:

* __Go on things that negatively affect my mood__: Avoiding twitter, 4ch (and related communities/people) / hivemind thought / crab mentality
* __Not double-checking stuff__: Ordering PCBs with a missed/wrong trace, leaving an AWS EKS server up for a whole month ðŸ˜¬
* __Buying stuff I'll never use__: Clothes, domains etc.
* __Feeding into sadges__: Listening to sad stuff when sad == bad
* __Drinking so much__: impulsivity in general
* __Falling for propaganda__: E.g. Plastics industry propagating recycling into the mainstream to ease consumer guilt about purchasing said plastics - or even "mental health awareness" days, things designed to manipulate our behaviour for the sake of being a more efficient machine in the system / spending money 

> The concept of "mental health" in our society is defined largely by the extent to which an individual behaves in accord with the needs of the system and does so without showing signs of stress.
