There goes >7 years of posting history. Pretty relieved to have all that off the
public record, my 17 year old self... well - what are 17 year olds like. I'm 25
right now, which is equal parts surprising and unsettling. You might ask why
come back? Why write?

Despite the trouble writing has often gotten me into, I really just can't seem
to help myself. Ideas just tend to rattle around in my head and refuse to shift
unless put down somewhere. I remember when I was interviewing for my very first
developer job & finding out that the interviewers had managed to read my more
private blog posts because I had neglected to filter the `private: true` posts
from my RSS feed. That was a fun one.

The internet has become a difficult place to remain anonymous in the last couple
decades, there's aren't any "safe" places left, maybe Tumblr at a push. Even
then, I still don't like being a cloud serf for a faceless corporation. Whatever
value we create is not respected, nor do we receive any compensation for it. So
I'm back here - back on my little island in the vast expanse talking into the
void.

Hi.
