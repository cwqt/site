## lessons

- vocal weight
- nurdling: sounding like stitch, avoid that! (fairly common)
- re-listening to recorded vt lessons is painful
- doing literally anything imaginable to avoid speaking, a la infinite
  scrolling, checking e-mails, writing this post...
- mimicry: very based, I have a bunch of clips I just play back & emulate

going from low to higher pitch while keeping low weight

## how not to want to die when voice training

- play spotify in background on speaker
- ease into it by just _making sound_

There's a lot of resources out there for altering ones voice, so this is an
attempt at collecting it all and filtering out the extraneous data, I'll link
the sources for more detailed reading so think of this as a 'learn x in y' for
voice

# Confidence

i have virtually zero confidence, even trying to alter my voice causes a lot of
tension, & often i'll sit in my chair for hours just thinking about starting
before i actually summon up the will to practice -- some things that've helped
me:

- alcohol
- playing music in the background (don't play sad stuff though)
- being in a room where noone can reasonbly hear you
- watching vt videos to ease into it

ok onto the training, few big components; vocal weight, intonation, resonance &
pitch.

# Vocal Weight

really freaking important, smooth or rough

how much air you let through without making sound

abduction: breathy adducted: creaky

## Exercises

- pitch slides for thinness: go from rough to smooth via pitch, then decrease
  pitch while maintaining thinness
  - fry to thin
  - aaaaaa ^^ one two three...
- thick to thin pop test: fuck knows
- pure mimicry:
- physical compression of head and neck: jar your neck in & out to cause vocal
  tract to be stretched
- onset and offset approach:

# Resonance

changing vocal resonance through altering the length of the layrnx siren
whispers, big dog small dog (!!) vampire noise, going from low to high ha, haw,
haaaa --> vocalisation then speech say hah not heh or hih since that's the
tongue shape altering resonance (oral cavity)

raising the layrnx too high will result in choking, bouncing on the palete don't
use neck muscles, more of a tongue muscle action don't strain the vocal chords

# Pitch

140-180hz androgynous 160-250hz feminine

# Open Quotient

# Intonation

without this you sound like yourself, just unaffected by testosterone

# Articulation

# Twang

# Throat Closure

Close off the nasal passage by raising the soft palete & reducing nasality /
increase resonance

# Oropharynx constriction
