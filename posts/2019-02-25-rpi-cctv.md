I'm waiting for a job. In the meantime I've been keeping myself occupied with a few things, [remaking the PiSP onto a PiSP]() and now this, a CCTV camera. There's been a few burgalaries in the area so I figured I'd put something in place to potentially ward off anyone wanting to break in.

## Concept

**Quantitative**

A wireless CCTV camera with night vision with live feed GUI.

**Qualitative**

- Operate from a 5V supply, <= 2A
- Operate for 1 hour on a backup power source (3.7v LiPo)
- Capture at least FHD images at 7.5-15fps
- Store at least 2 weeks of history
- Be able to see 15m-20m in low-light (IR)
- Display a live feed through localhost
