title: The U+NION building gives me the creeps

I moved to Manchester a couple months ago now, it's a nice place, bigger than
Bristol, smaller than London, a decent sized city where one could reasonably
walk the diameter of the ring-road in under an hour. When I go outside in the
evening to take in the brisk autumnal air, watch the sunset as its pink & blue
tints fade to black (and to have a smoke) - I always notice the U+NION building
off in the background.

U+NION (<https://liveunion.com/>) is a skyscaper presenting fully erect and
piercing into the Mancunian skyline, adorned with a great neon sign glowing it's
great white hue - often handily acting as the lighthouse that guides me home
since I no longer carry a smartphone on my outings. Doubly it serves many a
young professional as their place of residence.

A co-living space, gym, cafe/bar & club all rolled into one starting at 900 odd
quid per month. For a young professional on a salary of ~30k that'd represent
~30-40% of a monthly income, bills included - not too bad all considered in the
present day. The building itself is owned by Vita Group Holdings Ltd,
self-proclaimed "urban development regeneration specialist" and "fully
vertically-integrated developer, seller and operator of property investment
products"
[whose revenue & EBITDA in 2024](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/11963176/filing-history/MzQ4MjM0MjkwOGFkaXF6a2N4/document?format=pdf&download=0)
stood at £254.2m and £62.5m respectively.

So what about it? it's just a business, why do I even care?. The issue I take is
that I feel the U+NION's community aspect is structurally disingenuous, and
scratching the surface reveals it a pre-packaged sense of authentic urban
community cooked up in a boardroom with the aim of increasing tenant retention.
Togetherness As A Service. I did some research and found that as a tenant, upon
admission you're to take some sort of test and then algorithmically matched with
the people who you're to live with, very helpfully replacing the messiness that
comes with organically creating social relationships. I expect meeting your
neighbours goes something like: _"Hello, The Algorithm™ has placed us in close
proximity due to the quantatative overlap of our personality metrics and
interests - lovely to make your acquaintance!"_. U+NION needs the people that
live there to form connections as lonely, isolated or conflicting tenants are
more likely to leave.

Besides from a roof over your head, for £90/pm you can join _U+_, their
residents membership - gaining access to staff-hosted community events, free
laundry, additional spaces etc. Looking into their Instagram reveals that such
community events are also primarily to the benefit of Vita Group: pub crawls
route tenants between other nearby Vita Group owned buildings and bars, pizza
nights source food in-house from Vita Group owned restaurants. The social life
is a closed loop with all funds flowing upwards rather than between the local
economy. Though they do also seem to intersperse non-profit-seeking activities
like painting, yoga or knitting every now and then... so that's cool I guess.

This comes across to me as a corporation mediating young people's social lives,
and perhaps cynically - the community built within exists as a value-add to
shareholders. The friendships tenants form are real, sure, and may outlast their
tenancy, but still, their formation is algorithmically engineered and
extractive. Just to be clear, I don't think U+NION is uniquely evil, but the
trajectory _is_ the furthering of the commodification of community itself. They
offer the aesthetic of community but retain all structural power - a
multi-national corporation designs their social life to minimize churn and thus
increase profits.

Contrasted against history, previous generations of people formed communities
through institutions they themselves controlled or co-created: churches (A neat
example from history I learned recently from
[The Green Ages](https://profilebooks.com/work/the-green-ages/) is the
[Beguines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beguines_and_Beghards) of medieval
Europe, they ran their own semi-monastic communities without corporate or
ecclesiastical oversight.), unions, neighborhood associations, or housing
co-operatives. Not that those don't exist anymore or were perfect, but
increasingly socialisation is brokered through corporations, and U+NION serves
as a shining beacon of an example.

Vita Group has capitalized on a fertile opportunity for rent extraction created
by two converging conditions: the atomized, isolated nature of contemporary
urban life generates demand for community, and housing scarcity that eliminates
alternatives, thus monetizing loneliness and necessity simultaneously. The
building looms over the city, glowing its promise of belonging. What it actually
illuminates is how thoroughly we're allowing capital to intermediate the basic
human need for connection.
