There's a lot of resources out there for altering ones voice, so this is an attempt at collecting it all and filtering out the extraneous data, I'll link the sources for more detailed reading so think of this as a 'learn x in y' for voice

# Resonance

changing vocal resonance through altering the length of the layrnx
siren whispers, big dog small dog
(!!) vampire noise, going from low to high
ha, haw, haaaa --> vocalisation then speech
say hah not heh or hih since that's the tongue shape altering resonance (oral cavity)

raising the layrnx too high will result in choking, bouncing on the palete
don't use neck muscles, more of a tongue muscle action
don't strain the vocal chords

# Pitch

140-180hz androgynous
160-250hz feminine

# Open Quotient

# Intonation

# Articulation

# Twang

# Throat Closure

Close off the nasal passage by raising the soft palete & reducing nasality / increase resonance 

# Oropharynx constriction
