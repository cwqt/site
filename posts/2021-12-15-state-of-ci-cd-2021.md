## understanding ci/ci

![ci/cd stack](https://ftp.cass.si/6Qz321e15.png)

All a CD pipeline is is an artifact shuffler that can kick off dependent CI
jobs.

The rest is just Remote Code Execution as a service.

- push code (GitLab)
- compile binary, push to storage (earthly)
- RPC to containers to pull new binary (Cloud Run)
- bootloader mounts binary (Container)
  - bootloader is a docker image, provided with a yaml "specfile"
  - "specfile" tells the bootloader how to pull down & run the application
  - bootloader manages keeping the process alive
